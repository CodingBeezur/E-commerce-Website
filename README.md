# E-commerce-Website
Capstone Project for PluralSight

Project description: 
Use what we know about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create an e-commerce site. 

The website will include 5 pages to be complete. You will also be required to include certain HTML elements on your site including but not limited to HTML tables, HTML forms, images, lists, semenatic HTML Element, and Bootstrap components. 


About my approach:
As I worked on this project, I decided to create a website about rare sneakers. This comes from my general love for streetwear type of clothing. The biggest motivators for my website were:
* Bodega [https://bdgastore.com/]
* StockX [https://stockx.com/]
* Off-White [https://www.off---white.com/en-us/]

First thing that came in to mind was to establish a theme for the website. I believed that since there was no theme; I would have no direction. So after a bit of work on my Nav-bar and footer.  I found one that fit my idea.

Now that I finished that, I decided to focus on placing the required items on each page before I were to go into depth about customizing them.
