# E-commerce-Website
#Capstone Project for PluralSight

### Project description: 
Use what we know about HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create an e-commerce site. 

The website will include 5 pages to be complete. You will also be required to include certain HTML elements on your site including but not limited to HTML tables, HTML forms, images, lists, semenatic HTML Element, and Bootstrap components. 


### About my approach:
As I worked on this project, I decided to create a website about rare sneakers. This comes from my general love for streetwear. The biggest motivators for my website were:
* Bodega [https://bdgastore.com/]
* StockX [https://stockx.com/]
* Off-White [https://www.off---white.com/en-us/]

First thing that came in to mind was to establish a theme for the website. I believed that since there was no theme; I would have no direction. So after a bit of work on my Nav-bar and footer.  I found one that fit my idea.

Now that I finished that, I decided to focus on placing the required items on each page before I were to go into depth about customizing them. 

### Favorite Component of my project
My favorite part of my project has to be image flip on hoover. It was a bit of a challenge because of the limitation on languages on the project, but overall really happy with it. I have attached a gif below to see.

### Lessons I learned  & thoughts before presentation 
The biggest lesson I learned was how to properly structure my website. What I also learned is that:

* 95% of what I want to build is already built .
* Bootstrap will make your life easy.
* There is an answer to your issue on the internet somewhere.
* Things break, just have to be patient and disect the issue. 

I overshot my aspiration's for this presentation and had to re-define my goals for this project. There is some components which I didn't really troubleshoot to truly fix because of time.

### Last thoughts - Post Presentation 
I am always eager to learn, I know there is alot of work that I have to do but appreciate my instructor, Gregor Dzierzon, and my classmates for being there to help me.

This was my first project using HTML/Bootstrap/CSS. It was a big challenge, but I have learned a lot from it. One day, I will comeback to redo this website after I learned much more. 

Thank you for taking the time and reading this.
